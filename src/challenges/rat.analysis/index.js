        Imagine that we have been given coordinates for point A and point B.
        These coordinates denote the start and end of a hypotenues of a right
        angle triangle. How much other information can we determine from these
        coordinates?

        In this challenge, we are going to calculate and then display
        (visualise) as much information as we can find, on a given RAT from only
        its hypotenues. We will find:

          <li>Coordinates of the triangle verticies.</li>
          <li>Perimeter of the triangle.</li>
          <li>Angles of the triangle</li>
          <li>Area of the triangle</li>
        </ul>
        all from 2 coordinates (ðŸ˜Š).

        The image above shows 4 different hypotenues, AB. AD, AF and AH. The
        dotted lines show the triangles that they form.
